# Intro

This is a basic URL shortner made with next.js and mongodb

This was made in a day or two so it's definitely not complete

To run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/asuyou/shortify
$ cd shortify
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
```

Make sure to fill out `.env.local` with something like

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/
MONGODB_DB=shortify
```
